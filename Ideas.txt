1. If other has a quad. move where other has quad.
-They'll win if we don't, since next turn they place piece

2. If we have a quad and they dont... win
-Opposite situation as #1

3. If other has a triple and we dont have a quad, block them
-If we can't immediately win, we should look towards making sure they can't set themselves up *too* well.

4. If we have a triple and they don't have a quad, expand on the triple so we can win next turn

5. Unless they have a triple as well, then favor blocking (? (they'll probably block us))

6. If they keep blocking and don't mess up, seek to cat the board (?)

7. If not #6, then go on the offensive and try to force a more favorable situation
- Set up a double win, block them until they make a mistake, etc (perhaps have modes, defensive, offensive, etc, based on current board state-makes it easier to debug and looks cool :) )

?. If all the above are false, just pick the best place off of location score.
